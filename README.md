# Simple-String-Parsing

***
Reasons you would want to use this:
none

This is a simple function I use for parsing strings, efficient enough for my needs and though I would make it public incase anyone would need it and for somereason can't find or make something that suits their needs (I doubt that is even possible though). This is probably not thread and/or exception safe as I have no clue what either what they are or how to make them safe. Use at your own risk.
